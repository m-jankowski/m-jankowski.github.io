    <b>Welcome!</b><br><br>
    I'm a political scientist by training and currently work as a Data Scientist in the Data Lab of the German Federal Chancellery, where I help drive evidence-based policy-making and digitalize public administration.<br><br>
    Before this, I worked in academia, focusing on quantitative methods for analyzing party and voter behavior. I earned my PhD from the University of Oldenburg for a set of studies examining interactions among voters, candidates, and parties in multi-level systems. Even though I'm no longer at a university, I continue researching populism, candidate selection, and political representation.<br><br>
    In December 2024, my co-edited textbook <i>Populism. An Introduction</i> was published by SAGE. It's the first comprehensive textbook for teaching populism, emphasizing empirical research. You can order it from 
    <a href='https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/populism/book286771' target='_blank'>SAGE</a>, 
    <a href='https://www.amazon.de/Populism-Introduction-Robert-Huber/dp/1529669863' target='_blank'>Amazon</a>, 
    or your local bookstore.<br><br>
    My main Data Science interests lie in NLP, causal analysis, and survey research. Most of my code is in R, and I've built various R Shiny web apps, although I'm also expanding my skill set by learning Python and React.<br><br>
    I have also conducted several workshops on web scraping, large language models (LLMs), survey experiments, and data visualizationâ€”helping researchers and practitioners refine their skills in data analysis and technology.<br><br>
    Discover a brief overview of my work history and publications below. If you have any questions or just want to connect, I'd love to hear from you!<br><br>
